    <h1> “Hesitations Outside the Door” </h1>
    
  <p>  I’m telling the wrong lies,<br>
they are not even useful.<br>

The right lies would at least<br>
be keys, they would open the door.<br>

The door is closed; the chairs,<br>
the tables, the steel bowl, myself<br>

shaping bread in the kitchen, wait<br>
outside it.
